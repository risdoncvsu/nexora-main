     * done by editing the SQL text inside the OLD migration file
     * (2026_07_20_000004_update_deliveries_status_check.php). Laravel only
     * runs a migration once and remembers it by filename in the
     * `migrations` table, so editing that file's contents did nothing to
     * a database where it had already run — the live `deliveries_status_check`
     * constraint (and any existing rows) were still using the old
     * 'in-transit' value. Meanwhile every controller/JS file was updated to
     * send 'intransit' (no dash), so every new delivery insert/update was
     * rejected by the database with a CHECK constraint violation — that is
     * the "PO logging errors" bug. This migration brings the live database
     * in sync with the current 'intransit' convention.
